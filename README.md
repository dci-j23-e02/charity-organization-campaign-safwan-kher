### Level of Difficulty: Hard
### Title: Comprehensive Charity Organization Campaign Management System
### Overview: 

In this assignment, you are tasked with creating a comprehensive Java application for a charity organization named "Helping Hands". The application will be used to manage a campaign to raise funds for various projects. The application should be able to track the details of the donors, the amount of donations received, the total funds raised, the specific projects that the donations are allocated to, and the volunteers who are working on these projects. The application should be console-based and should not have a user interface.

The application should be designed in a way that it can handle a large number of donors, volunteers, projects, and donations. It should also be able to perform various operations like adding, updating, deleting, and viewing the details of the donors, volunteers, projects, and donations. The application should also be able to calculate the total funds raised, the total funds raised for a specific project, and the average donation amount. It should also be able to find the top donor, the most active volunteer, the project that has received the most donations, and the project that has the most volunteers assigned.

### Overview of Essential Java Collections for Assignment Implementation:

1. **HashMap:** HashMap is a part of the Java collections framework. It uses a technique called Hashing. HashMap contains values based on the key. It contains only unique elements. It may have one null key and multiple null values. It maintains no order. HashMap is non synchronized. It is not thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code. HashMap is a good choice when we have to search, update or delete elements based on the key.

   **Example:**
   ```java
   HashMap<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<Integer, String>();
   map.put(1, "John Doe");
   map.put(2, "Jane Smith");
   System.out.println("Value for key 1 is: " + map.get(1));
   ```
   **Use Case:** In this assignment, HashMap is used to store the details of the donors with the donor's ID as the key and the donor object as the value. This allows quick access to donor details using the donor's ID.

2. **HashSet:** HashSet is a Set implementation that uses a hash table for storage. A HashSet is a collection of items where every item is unique, and it is found in the java.util package. It inherits the AbstractSet class and implements the Set interface.

   **Example:**
   ```java
   HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<String>();
   set.add("John Doe");
   set.add("Jane Smith");
   System.out.println("Set contains John Doe: " + set.contains("John Doe"));
   ```
   **Use Case:** In this assignment, HashSet is used to store the details of the volunteers. This allows quick access to volunteer details and ensures that there are no duplicate volunteers.

3. **TreeMap:** TreeMap in Java is a part of the Java Collection framework. It implements the NavigableMap interface and extends AbstractMap class. It is a Red-Black tree based NavigableMap implementation. In TreeMap, the elements are sorted in ascending order.

   **Example:**
   ```java
   TreeMap<String, String> map = new TreeMap<String, String>();
   map.put("Clean Water Project", "Providing clean water to remote areas");
   map.put("Education Project", "Providing education to underprivileged children");
   System.out.println("Project details for Clean Water Project: " + map.get("Clean Water Project"));
   ```
   **Use Case:** In this assignment, TreeMap is used to store the details of the projects with the project's name as the key and the project object as the value. This allows quick access to project details using the project's name and keeps the projects sorted.

4. **LinkedList:** LinkedList is a linear data structure which allows to insert and remove elements at the front and rear in constant time. LinkedList elements are not stored in contiguous locations like arrays, they are linked with each other using pointers. 

   **Example:**
   ```java
   LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<String>();
   list.add("Donation1");
   list.add("Donation2");
   System.out.println("First donation in the list: " + list.get(0));
   ```
   **Use Case:** In this assignment, LinkedList is used to store the details of the donations. This allows easy addition and removal of donations.

Each of these collections has its own advantages and use cases, and they are chosen in this assignment based on the specific requirements of each task. For example, HashMap is chosen to store donor details because it allows quick access to elements using the key, HashSet is chosen to store volunteer details because it ensures that there are no duplicate volunteers, TreeMap is chosen to store project details because it keeps the elements sorted, and LinkedList is chosen to store donation details because it allows easy addition and removal of elements.
